							<h2>A little about myself</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Hi, I'm Ali. I'm a computer engineer who's passionate about making video games.<br>
							I've been working with Unity and Unreal for a few years, mainly focusing on learning the engine and how to make games.
							Now, I'm learning software design patterns and test driven development to help me improve code readability, 
							scalability, and refactoring.<br>
							I'm also interested in artificial intelligence, which includes machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and so on.
							And I actually used some of these concepts in games, like in Flappy Bird that you'll see in the 'Recent Work' section.<br>
							Feel free to hit me up with questions or comments, or just to chat!

								<br>
								<p> Breachers is a multiplayer FPS game made using Unreal Engine. Till now, there's a deathmatch mode,
									and there's a plant and defuse mode that's in progress. While it's very similar to Counter Strike, there are a few new ideas in mind.
									For example, the bomb will not spawn with the attackers. Instead, it'll spawn somewhere random in the map, and both the attackers and
									defenders will look for it, while dealing with each other. The defenders will also have the ability to take the bomb and possibly hide it from
									the attackers. This will create new gameplay dynamic and tactics. It'll be very interesting to see how the interactions will turn out.
									There are many more ideas like these ones.

						<h2>Recent Work</h2>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">These are the games I'm most proud of (till now).
							I spent some time on these games trying to polish and improve some of the mechanics that I already knew.
							Some of the aspects that I was working on perfecting were jumping mechanics, UI elements, and code optimization.</p>

									I will add weapons and a dialog system soon.

								<p> This isn't a game per se. It was an AR assessment for a job. And it was my first ever experience with AR.
									The idea was to have 3 different images to track, and each image had its unique set of characters that the user can scroll through.
									And when you tap the character, an UI menu appears that show info about them and buttons to control them.

						<h2>Mini Concepts</h2>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">I made these games in the very beginning when I first started learning game development.
							They are small games that got me started and got my hands dirty. Each one of these games gave me experience in a particular mechanic
							or a tool in Unity. This was really helpful for my learning journey because I learned a lot copying other games and understood how they were made.</p>
